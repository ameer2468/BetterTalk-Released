# BetterTalk-Released

I have spent a few months working on this project. It's an app to meant to allow people to vent by talking to a Volunteer. Unfortunately, due to legal issues, I could not proceed with
releasing this app to the globe.

Building this app exposed me to React Native and Firebase. I've learned quite alot, and frankly, the structure of the project can be improved. There's a 1 or 2 bugs that you may discover, rest is all well.

This app is built with:

- React Native, managed EXPO CLI
- Firebase
- Redux Toolkit (state management)
- Typescript (Definitions are incomplete in the project)

Do whatever you want with the code, however, if you use it for your own project, please give credits where due.
