# BetterTalk-Released

I have spent a few months working on this project. It's an app to meant to allow people to vent by talking to a Volunteer. Unfortunately, due to legal issues, I could not proceed with
releasing this app to the globe.

This app is built with:

- React Native, managed EXPO CLI
- Firebase
- Redux Toolkit (state management)
- Typescript (Definitions are incomplete in the project)

Do whatever you want with the code, however, if you use it for your own project, please give credits where due.
